# Implementation overview
#
# The model is a common smooth surface plus deviations for the levels of f.
# This file builds the deviations. At each covariate combination, they sum to
# zero over f. A separate factor g supplied through by replicates this entire
# term; mgcv remains responsible for that replication and its penalties.
#
# There are two stages to mgcv's setup:
#   1. smooth.info() describes the variables and margins before the model frame
#      is built. For a factor by variable, we add a factor recording
#      the observed (f, g) pairs.
#   2. smooth.construct() builds the basis and penalties from the supplied data.
#      In discrete bam, those data have already been compressed by margin.
#
# The extra factor is necessary because independently compressed f and g no
# longer have matching rows. We cannot compare those columns to check whether
# they encode the same grouping. The paired factor retains that information.
# Its basis is just a column of ones: including it in a tensor product changes
# neither the fitted function nor the number of coefficients or penalties.
#
# Keep the coefficient order consistent across X, S, margin, and XP. The order
# is factor contrasts, then continuous margins in the user's covariate order,
# then the constant validation margin (when present).
#
# Regression coverage: tests/tesz.R checks the basis and penalties against
# explicit contrasts; tests/tesz-discrete.R checks both prediction paths, actual
# covariate rounding, and grouping checks after subsetting and NA removal.

#' Sum-to-zero factor interactions with tensor product smooths
#'
#' Constructs a tensor product of two or more one-dimensional continuous
#' margins, with deviations that sum to zero across the levels of one factor.
#'
#' @details
#' Specify the term using `s(x, z, f, bs = "tesz")`, where `f` is a factor.
#' The position of the factor among the covariates does not matter. The smooth
#' is a tensor product despite being specified with [mgcv::s()].
#'
#' Supply continuous-margin options in `xt`: `k`, `bs`, `m`, and `xt` are
#' passed to [mgcv::te()] in the order of the continuous covariates. Defaults
#' are those of `te()` (cubic regression spline margins with dimension 5).
#' Specify marginal `k` and `m` inside `xt`, not in the outer `s()` call.
#'
#' With `xt$shared = TRUE` (the default), there is one smoothing parameter per
#' continuous direction, shared across factor levels. With
#' `xt$shared = FALSE`, there is one per factor level and direction. The latter
#' penalizes the original level-specific surfaces, not the contrast surfaces.
#'
#' An orthonormal contrast basis absorbs the coefficient sum-to-zero constraint.
#' At every covariate combination, the deviations sum to zero across factor
#' levels with equal weights. The term includes factor offsets; adding the
#' same factor as a parametric effect would duplicate these offsets.
#'
#' A separate factor supplied to `by` replicates the term using mgcv's standard
#' handling, preserving the sum-to-zero constraint within each represented
#' `by` level. Ordered factors omit the first level as usual. The `by` factor
#' must not encode the same grouping as the sum-to-zero factor, independently
#' of labels and level ordering. An internal categorical margin preserves
#' observed pairs of factor levels through model-frame subsetting, missing-value
#' removal, and discretization. The constructor checks equivalence using these
#' pairs, rather than comparing independently discretized factor columns.
#' This auxiliary margin has one constant basis function and introduces no
#' additional coefficients or penalties. No fitting wrapper is required.
#'
#' Both ordinary and discrete [mgcv::bam()] fitting are supported. Discrete
#' fitting stores the factor-contrast margin and each continuous margin
#' separately. Numeric `by` variables, outer `id` and `fx`, multiple sum-to-zero
#' factors, use as a tensor-product margin, and custom plotting are not
#' supported. The coefficient count is `(nlevels(f) - 1) * prod(k)`.
#'
#' @param object A smooth specification from [mgcv::s()] for the constructor,
#'   or a fitted `tesz.smooth` object for the prediction method.
#' @param data A list or data frame containing the covariates and any `by`
#'   variable required by the term.
#' @param knots Optional knots for the continuous margins.
#' @return The constructor returns a `tesz.smooth` object containing the
#'   design matrix, penalties, and information required for prediction.
#'   The prediction method returns the corresponding model matrix.
